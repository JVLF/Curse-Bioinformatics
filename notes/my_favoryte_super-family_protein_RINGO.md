#My Favoryte Super-family protein 

##RINGO/Speedy

------
The superfamily RINGO/Speedy was originally discovered in Xenopus ocytes

They are a cell cycle regulatory proteins

Speedy (Spy1) is a cell cycle regulatory protein which activates CDK2, the major kinase that allows progression through G1/S phase and further replication events. Spy1 expression overcomes a p27-induced cell cycle arrest to allow for DNA synthesis, so cell cycle progression occurs due to an interaction between Spy1 and p27. Spy1 is also known as Ringo protein A.

Speedy/RINGO family members bind and activate cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs), although these proteins have no homology to known cyclin proteins. Members of this family are required for and enhance meiotic maturation, in addition to having novel roles in regulating the mitotic mammalian cell cycle and the DNA damage response. Here we discuss how the specialized functions of these proteins differ from classical cyclin-mediated activation of CDKs. Through atypical activation of CDKs, bypass of conventional inhibitory mechanisms, and unique substrate selection, Speedy/RINGO proteins contribute to cell cycle, checkpoint, and apoptotic regulation. Furthermore, we address the recently established correlation between Spy1 and cancer in terms of the specialized functions of the Speedy/RINGO family.
